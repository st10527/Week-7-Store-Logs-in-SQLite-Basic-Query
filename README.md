# Week 6 â€“ Initial Dashboard UI (Streamlit)

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

This week, you'll begin building a simple **web-based dashboard** for your data center monitor using **Streamlit**.  
You will read system metrics from `log.csv` and display them in a dashboard format with tables and charts.

---

## ðŸ§  Reminder: Where does `log.csv` come from?

Your `log.csv` file should already exist from **Week 4 or Week 5**.  
It contains fields like:  
`Timestamp, CPU, Memory, Disk, Ping_Status, Ping_ms`

If you **donâ€™t have one**, you can generate it by re-running your previous logger script (e.g., from Week 5):

``bash
python main.py

This will log 5 entries with system info and create log.csv.

Alternatively, you can use the example below.

ðŸ§ª Sample log.csv (Optional)

If needed, copy the following and save it as log.csv in the same folder:

Timestamp,CPU,Memory,Disk,Ping_Status,Ping_ms
